# HaiChat

## Introduction

HaiChat (stands for Hybrid AI Chat) is a prototype ChatBot, available in offline and online modes (hence the Hybrid in the name).
The offline mode is build on vLLM and currently using the TinyLlama model (for prototyping purposes), while the online mode operates on Mistral AI SDK.

The idea behind this project is to offer the option for the user to choose whether they need to prioritize their privacy (maybe a company's privacy) and prefer to utilize the power of AI locally, or let them choose the cloud option that saves them compute and resources.

This project was also inspired by the idea of showcasing my AI software engineering skills and practices, ranging from infrastructure setup to coding and prototyping.
